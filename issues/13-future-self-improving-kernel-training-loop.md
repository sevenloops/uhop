# Self-improving kernel training loop

Stage: Future

Labels: ai, research

## Description
Continuously refine kernels using performance and correctness signals (reinforcement loop).

## Goals

- Define reward metrics and exploration strategy
- Safeguards to maintain correctness

## Acceptance Criteria

- Prototype or design notes with small-scale results
