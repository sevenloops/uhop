# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Preferred: use GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting if available on this repository.

If that is not available, contact the maintainers privately (e.g., via organization email) and provide:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- A proposed disclosure timeline

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and will coordinate on fixes and disclosure.
