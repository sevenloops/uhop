# Help Wanted: OSS Maintainers and Contributors

We’re opening UHOP to the community and looking for contributors and maintainers to help mature the project.

## Areas where help is most impactful

- Issue triage and grooming (convert rough notes into actionable issues)
- Documentation (README, website Docs, examples, troubleshooting)
- CI/CD hardening (GitHub Actions, coverage, packaging)
- Pre-commit and lint rules (Python + frontend)
- Testing (unit, correctness, and performance smoke tests)
- Kernel backends (OpenCL kernels, heuristics, autotune, optional CLBlast)
- Integrations (PyTorch ergonomics, Triton optional paths)

## Getting started

1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and run the local quick start.
2. Use `uhop info --json` to capture environment info when filing backend issues.
3. For docs work, see `frontend/` and the Docs page content.

## Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and scoped; follow the PR template checklist.
- Add or update tests for user-visible behavior.
- Prefer clear, actionable issue reports with repro steps.

If you’d like to help maintain the project, please comment on this issue with your areas of interest and availability. Thank you!
